For our Project-1 we are using a previous project to do unit testing.This project is a Website intends to solve the hassle of searching home tutor or someone eligible who is looking for some extra money to earn through teaching, then this is the platform for them. The students will give their information like in which medium they read in and in which class and where they live. Our website will then generate a Fee and if they agree to accept that they are willing to pay this much then an ad will post in the tutors profiles and if a tutor accept this offer then the Name and Contact number of the student will then be shown to the tutor.This website is built using Django Framework. So we would do our unit testing on “unittest” – Unit testing framework for Django.The “unittest” unit testing framework was originally inspired by JUnit and has a similar flavor as major unit testing frameworks in other languages. It supports test automation, sharing of setup and shutdown code for tests, aggregation of tests into collections, and independence of the tests from the reporting framework.[1]References: [1] https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#module-unittest
